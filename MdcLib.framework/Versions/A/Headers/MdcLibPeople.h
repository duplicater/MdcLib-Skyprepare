 MdcLib People API.
 
 @abstract
 Access to the MdcLib People API, available as a property on the main
 MdcLib API.
 
 @discussion
 <b>You should not instantiate this object yourself.</b> An instance of it will
 be available as a property of the main MdcLib object. Calls to MdcLib
 People methods will look like this:
 
 <pre>
 [mdclib.people increment:@"App Opens" by:[NSNumber numberWithInt:1]];
 </pre>
 
 Please note that the core <code>MdcLib</code> and
 <code>MdcLibPeople</code> classes share the <code>identify:</code> method.
 The <code>MdcLib</code> <code>identify:</code> affects the
 <code>distinct_id</code> property of events sent by <code>track:</code> and
 <code>track:properties:</code> and determines which MdcLib People user
 record will be updated by <code>set:</code>, <code>increment:</code> and other
 <code>MdcLibPeople</code> methods.
 
 <b>If you are going to set your own distinct IDs for core MdcLib event
 tracking, make sure to use the same distinct IDs when using MdcLib
 People</b>.

 This will associate the device token with the current user in MdcLib People,

 People web interface. You should call this method with the <code>NSData</code>

 Set properties on the current user in MdcLib People.
 
 @discussion
 The properties will be set on the current user. The keys must be NSString
 objects and the values should be NSString, NSNumber, NSArray, NSDate, or
 NSNull objects. We use an NSAssert to enforce this type requirement. In
 release mode, the assert is stripped out and we will silently convert
 incorrect types to strings using [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@", value]. You
 can override the default the current project token and distinct ID by
 including the special properties: $token and $distinct_id. If the existing
 user record on the server already has a value for a given property, the old
 value is overwritten. Other existing properties will not be affected.

 This method is identical to <code>set:</code> except it will only set
 properties that are not already set. It is particularly useful for collecting
 data about the user's initial experience and source, as well as dates
 representing the first time something happened.
